# poppulsepaper

This repo contains the code used to implement the work in the paper in this repo (Horton-Manuscript-Draft.pdf). The SingleSubject-UnifLogNormPrior folder has the Bayesian Deconvolution model for fitting a single subject.  The Pop-UnifLogNormPrior folder contains the new model extension. It is code to perform Bayesian Deconvolution model for fitting a group of subjects.

In each folder are the source code (src), a single example simulated dataset, and the application data presented in the results of the paper. In the simulated and real data folders there is a single run from the code for the user to verify.  The results will not be identical because the seed changes each run, but the overall posterior distributions should be similar.
